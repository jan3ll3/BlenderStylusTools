# Pen Stylus Rotate for Blender

A Blender addon that enables natural viewport navigation using your stylus eraser. Perfect for artists who want to seamlessly switch between drawing and viewport manipulation.

## Features

- Use stylus eraser for intuitive viewport orbit and pan controls
- Pressure-sensitive control for smooth transitions
- View-relative rotation for predictable navigation from any angle
- Toggle the feature on/off in preferences

## Requirements

- Blender 4.2.0 or newer
- Windows with a pressure-sensitive stylus
- Windows Ink enabled in Blender preferences

## Installation

1. Download the latest release zip file
2. In Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons
3. Click "Install..." and select the downloaded zip file
4. Enable the addon by checking the checkbox
5. Ensure Windows Ink is enabled in Edit > Preferences > Input

## Usage

1. Press the stylus eraser against your tablet to start
2. Drag to orbit the view:
   - Up/down movement rotates around the view's horizontal axis
   - Left/right movement rotates around the view's vertical axis
3. Hold Shift while dragging to pan the view
4. Control pressure for smooth interaction:
   - Light pressure (< 0.2): pauses rotation/pan
   - Normal pressure (> 0.2): enables rotation/pan
   - No pressure: ends the operation
